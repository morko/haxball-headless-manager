# Haxball Headless Manager

The Haxball Headless Manager (HHM) is a script to make managing headless haxball
rooms easier and allow several headless scripts (plugins) to run in parallel and
interact with each other. For further information, see the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/saviola777/haxball-headless-manager). 

This page contains the HHM API documentation, as well as several guides
illustrating the structure and inner workings of the system:

- {@tutorial writing-plugins}: For plugin authors and users who want to get an
  overview of existing plugins.
- {@tutorial events}: For a more in-depth explanation of the HHM event handling
  and available event handlers.
